# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews. The dataset contains movie reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative). The objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sentiment of movie reviews based on their textual content.

## Project Structure
The project follows a structured approach:
- **Data Preprocessing**: The raw data is cleaned and preprocessed to prepare it for analysis. This includes steps such as tokenization, negation handling, and lowercase conversion.
- **Feature Extraction**: The textual data is transformed into numerical features using techniques such as vectorization and encoding.
- **Model Selection**: Various machine learning models are evaluated and compared to identify the most suitable model for sentiment analysis.
- **Training and Evaluation**: The selected model is trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess its performance.

## Data Description
- **Input Data**: Movie reviews in text format.
- **Output Data**: Sentiment labels (positive or negative) corresponding to each movie review.

## Implementation Details
- The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as pandas, NLTK, and scikit-learn.
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction are performed using appropriate methods and techniques from the NLTK and scikit-learn libraries.
- Model selection involves experimenting with various algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks, to determine the best-performing model.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the performance of the trained models.

## Conclusion
Movie review sentiment analysis is a valuable application of natural language processing and machine learning techniques. By accurately predicting the sentiment of movie reviews, this project can provide valuable insights to filmmakers, producers, and audiences alike. With proper data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model selection, the project aims to achieve high accuracy and robust performance in sentiment classification.
